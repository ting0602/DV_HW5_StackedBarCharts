# HW5_Stacked Bar Charts
**NYCU Data Visualization and Visual Analytics HW5**

- **Objective:**
  - Craft stacked bar charts to represent the World University Rankings using D3.
  - Data Source: http://vis.lab.djosix.com:2023/data/TIMES_WorldUniversityRankings_2024.csv
- **Requirements:**
  - Data Representation:
    - Every stacked bar should represent the total score of a particular university.
    - Within each bar, the scores for different criteria—namely teaching, research, citations, industry income, and international—should be clearly distinguishable.
  - Sorting Capability:
    - By overall scores.
    - By each individual criterion (teaching, research, citations, industry income, and international).
    - Both in ascending and descending orders.
- **Design Enhancements:**
  - Color Variations: Use distinct colors to represent each criterion within the stacked bars.
  - Interactive Features: Implement interactive elements such as tooltips that display exact scores when hovered over a specific section of the bar, or clickable legends to hide/show specific criteria.
  - Additional Techniques: Feel free to introduce any other design methodologies that can amplify the clarity and aesthetic of the data representation.
